### Read data

The data was exported from sqlite to csv using the [vscode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alexcvzz.vscode-sqlite), but was not altered in any way.

```{r}
csv_files <- list.files(path_raw_data, pattern = "\\.csv$", full.names = TRUE)

data <- csv_files |>
    map_df(read_csv)

head(data)
```

```
